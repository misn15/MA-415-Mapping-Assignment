# From the Cricket Grounds to Bar 35 

The maps below show a route from a local pub, Bar 35, to the cricket grounds. The map shows the walking route between these two destinations. The cricket grounds are not especially close to any nearby pubs and thus Bar 35 is situated a decent distance away from the grounds.
